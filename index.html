    <p>[High-Stakes Mission Briefing]</p>
    <p>
      Agent, you are about to embark on a mission that could determine the fate of the world. The nefarious Bombers have
      acquired an atomic bomb and are prepared to unleash its devastating power. The target: an unknown location that
      could result in catastrophic consequences on an unimaginable scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to track down the location of this deadly device before time runs
      out. Failure is not an option. Once you have pinpointed the bomb's location, our elite network of regional
      operatives will be deployed to neutralize the threat and disarm the weapon. Time is of the essence, and the fate
      of millions rests on your shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      To aid you in your pursuit, you will be provided with top-secret access to our satellite surveillance system.
      Input your security code to unlock the power of this cutting-edge technology and begin your harrowing quest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good luck, agent. The clock is ticking, and the world is counting on you. This message won't self-destruct in five
      seconds.
